How to program?
 --- To write a program or a logic of your problem in simple language
         hindi/english.
----- convert that language into your choice of programming language and in our case it will be python.
Eg: one number = 14, either this number is even or odd?
   varun 14/2 = 7 remainder = 0
python:
     a = 14
     if (a%2 == 0):
        print("a is even")
     else:
        print("a is odd")
 how will you convert it into a python?
 # syntax, variables, functions.
       programming concepts
Why Python?
python is been introduced in the year 1991, bit older than java, 1995
Guido van rossum --- he is a dutch scientist who works for dropbox.
Python is not a new language,
brcause of its data handling capabalities-- presence of libraries
Numpy, pandas, matplotlb,seaborn,plotly and sklearn, tensorflow and keras.
Raw format 
data analytics: combination of process to extract info from raw data.
                  1. Domain Knowledge
                  2. Statistical skills
                  3. prog language , python/R
Machine learning -- making predictions and finding the parameters.
What is Python?
Python is high-level,object-oriented,interpreted programming language.
Low level: Assembly language or machine learning
High level language : relatable to the human language.
Object-oriented : Everything in prog language considered as object.
                    An real world entity is considered as object.
Interpreted and compiled: execution of code happens line by line.
                           error line no: 45
                         execution happens in one go.
Which IDE we will used?
Jupyter notebook 
Anaconda -- platform spyder, jupyter --- data science jobs
